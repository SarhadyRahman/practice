                    work.
                    That's why I am looking for a Job. What kind of Job? Well I was thinking of something in
                    photography.

                <p>I've come a long way since I was the boy bit by a spider. Back then,
                    nothing seemed to go right for me. Now people really like me. The city is safe and sound. Guess I
                    had a little something to do with that. My uncle Ben would be proud. I still go to school. Top of my
                    class. And I'm in love, with the girl of my dreams</p>
